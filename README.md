## Password Generator (Scrimba Challenge)

For this I created a password generator with the ability of the user to set the length of the password generated between 8 and 15 characters as this was part of the stretch goals.

I also included a dynamic function which you can take and put it in any of your projects, which gives you the ability to copy from any id.

This is a challenge project, and I doubt that I will become more in the future, although the knowledge gained from this was very important.

You can find lessons that will teach you valuable coding over at [scrimba](www.scrimba.com), be sure to check it out.
